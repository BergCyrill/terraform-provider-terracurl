# TerraCurl Provider

This provider is designed to be a flexible extension of your terraform code to make managed and unamanged API calls to your target endpoint. Platform native Terraform providers should be preferred to TerraCurl but for instances where the platform provider does not have a resource or data source that you require, TerraCurl can be used to make substitute API calls to the target platform.


## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "terracurl" {

}
```
